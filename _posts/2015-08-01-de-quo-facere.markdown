<strong>Salve lector,</strong>

In this post we are going to discuss possible ideas for what a chapter can do to raise money.

Schools can raise money for nonprofits or for their own purposes, but no matter what, it raises the spirit of JCL in both the school as well as the recipient of the money. Here are some things you can do to raise money

* Sell Buttons
	* Make custom buttons with random Latin quotes on them! Quotes include but are not limited to:
		* "Amicitiae nostrae memoriam spero sempiternam fore" -Cicero
		* "Tu ne cede malis sed audentior ito" -Vergil
		* "Doctor Quis" -North Carolina JCL
		* "Specta Me Vipere" -Silento
* Have a Bake Sale!
	* Make Lemonade, Brownies, Cookies, and whatever else your heart so desires as long as it tastes good! 
* Make T-Shirts!
	* Make t-shirts with cool slogans on them! Providence High School had a really rad t-shirt in 2013 that had a Mockingjay on it and read "May the Gods Be Ever in Your Favor"
* Go to VCs - or other nearby stores
	* Go to some stores such as Harris Teeter, and explain your purpose and how JCL is such an amazing thing, and if you are just lucky enough, you may be able to score some cash!
* Get a Grant
	* If you apply to certain grants, you may luck out and get some funds for your JCL chapter!
