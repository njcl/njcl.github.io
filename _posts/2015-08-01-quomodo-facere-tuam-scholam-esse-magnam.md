<strong>Salve lector,</strong>

In this article, I will be discussing how to make your school's publicity work at its best level.

You really want your school to have an impact at this year's state convention. It's a big deal because there are so many big schools that always snatch up all the possible prizes. I bear good news - your school can get just as many awards. 

All events count for different points at State Convention. There's Certamen, Graphic Arts, Ludi/Olympika, and Academic Testing. Everyone has their niche, and should explore that area to dwelve the most into that facet of JCL, thus immersing oneself in the best of JCL that suits them the most.

First, there's Certamen. Certamen is the Classical Trivia Game. There's three teams of players between one and four players per team, and a moderator who asks questions. The moderator asks a question, and the team to get it correctly gets ten points, as well as two five-point bonus questions. 

Next, there's Graphic Arts competitions. There's a lot of categories for Graphic Arts, including poster, greeting card, comic, and photography among a myriad of other categories. These can also be entered into the National Competition, and contestants can compete without even attending National Convention.

Along with Graphic Arts, there's writing competitions, including Modern Myth and other essay writing competitions, in which contestants either write a mythological story in modern times, or write an essay about a given topic pertaining to the classics.

If none of these suit you, but you really like Latin in general, there's academic testing. The various subjects include Latin Grammar, Latin Reading Comprehension, Mythology, and Latin Derivatives.

Lastly, there's Ludi/Olympika for all the athletes in JCL. These are athletic competitions/races at conventions in which athletes run various races and compete to win
