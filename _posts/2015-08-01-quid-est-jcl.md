Salve, lector

JCL. Let's break that down. J - Junior. C - Classical. L - League.

The Junior Classical League is the second-largest student-led organization in the United States - second only to the Boy Scouts of America. At Fall Forum and State Convention, hundreds of students from across the state of North Carolina come to visit and immerse themselves in the classical languages. There's a multitude of things they can do, from Certamen, a game of Classical Trivia, to Ludi - Athletics that don't necessarily involve any knowledge of Latin or Greek. Those who do not like either of these can compete in Academic Testing in a variety of subjects to compete for the highest score (cf. Quomodo facere tuam scholam magnam esse).

As said earlier, there are two main events for North Carolina, and then National Convention at Indiana University. 

Fall Forum is a casual day-long event in November at UNC-Greensboro, in which new students of Latin can get a brief introduction into what the Junior Classical League is. They can try out in friendly competition without any awards all the events listed above. This tells them what exactly they want to do at State Convention - an actual competition in the Classics, held at UNC-Chapel Hill. 

State Convention is a full-on competition in which students can compete in Graphic Arts, Spirit, Ludi, Olympika, Certamen, and much much more. It's an amazing experience that everybody in the JCL must attend so they can realize just how amazing and inspiring the Classics are. 

<h3>To get started in the Junior Classical League in North Carolina, you can visit <a href="http://ncjcl.org">the NCJCL website</a>. It has a lot of information on membership, contests, and registration.</h3>
