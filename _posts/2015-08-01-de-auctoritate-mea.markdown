<strong>Salve lector,</strong>

My name is Andy Kamath. I am the second Vice President for North Carolina Junior Classical League. I have compiled a list here of multiple things a JCL chapter can do to get more involved in their state JCL, and how states can get more involved in the National Junior Classical League.

Cura et Valeas,<br>Andy Kamath
